<p><em><b>*Note:</b> publishing a new version of the WebExtension on the Firefox Extension Repository takes a lot of time (up to several months), due to checks performed by Mozilla. Therefore, the Firefox version available on the repository might not yet be the most recent one published by affilinet.</em></p>
